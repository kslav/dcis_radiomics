# MRI-based radiomics in ductal carcinoma *in situ*

Purpose: To develop logistic regression models of invasive upgrade on surgery and Oncotype DX Breast DCIS Score outcome using clinical and radiomic covariates.
Data: N=295 cases were analyzed from the ECOG-ACRIN E4112 trial.

Analysis
1. Primary: Identify radiomic biomarkers on MRI in N=295 cases with data available on disease upstaging on wide local excision surgery.
2. Secondary: Identify radiomic biomarkers on MRI in a subset of N=174 cases with DCIS Score results available.
